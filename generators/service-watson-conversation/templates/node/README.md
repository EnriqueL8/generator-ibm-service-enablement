# Watson Conversation

The IBM Watsonâ„¢ Conversation service combines machine learning, natural language understanding, and integrated dialog tools to create conversation flows between your apps and your users.

##  Credentials

###  LocalDevConfig

This is where your local configuration is stored for Watson Conversation.
```
{
  "watson_conversation_url": "{{{url}}}",
  "watson_conversation_username": "{{username}}",
  "watson_conversation_password": "{{password}}"
}
```

## Usage

The `service_manager` returns an instance of a `ConversationV1` client which is preconfigured to use the credentials supplied. You will need to specify the `workspace_id` for the conversation workspace you have created, as each service integration can include multiple workspaces. The full documentation for `python ConversationV1` can [be found here](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/?python),
but a small getting started example can be found below:

```javascript

```
